"H-hey, what're you doing?!" He wipes your eyes, flustered. You both blush -> 30
"Cmon, let's go to form." You walk to form and he sits nowhere near you -> 31

"Now I'm soaked... let's go to form." -> 22
You both go to form and Callum sits right next to you, despite his friends being in the other corner. -> 35

"Hey, I want you to stay with someone this week. Just to get you accustomed to the school and all that." [39,43]
"Hey... do you wanna stick with me... for a bit? You know, to get you used to the school, that's all." [42,46,47]
"I'm friends with Callum... I think." -> 40
"Great. I'll pair the two of you up." -> 45
Callum strolls over to you, clearly annoyed that you're stuck together. -> 49
"I'd love to!" -> 52
"I have 0 friends here." -> 44
"I really doubt that. Just go with Callum then, neither does he." -> 45
